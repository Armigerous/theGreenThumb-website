# Image Optimization Changes - October 8, 2025

## Problem

Hitting Vercel's 5,000 monthly image transformation limit with only 1.5k monthly visitors, causing images to fail and show fallback images.

## Root Cause

- Using both AVIF and WebP formats (2 transformations per image)
- Multiple device sizes and image size variants
- All images being optimized through Vercel's service

## Solution Implemented

Disabled all image optimization to stay within Vercel free tier limits. Images now serve unoptimized, which is acceptable at current traffic levels.

## Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

**Changed:** Line 92

```typescript
// Before:
unoptimized: false, // Reason: Enable optimization for better performance

// After:
// Reason: Disabled to stay within Vercel free tier limits (5k transformations/month)
// Current traffic: 1.5k visitors/month - optimization was causing limit issues
// To re-enable when revenue allows: set unoptimized: false
unoptimized: true,
```

### 2. Image Config (`lib/image-config.ts`)

**Changed:** Line 14

```typescript
// Before:
MAX_OPTIMIZED_IMAGES_PER_PAGE: 4,

// After:
// Reason: Set to 0 to stay within Vercel free tier limits
MAX_OPTIMIZED_IMAGES_PER_PAGE: 0,
```

Added documentation explaining:

- Why it's disabled (free tier limits)
- Current traffic stats (1.5k visitors vs 5k limit)
- How to re-enable when ready

## Architecture Verification

### Components Using Image Optimization

All components properly handle the `unoptimized` prop:

1. **OptimizedImage** (`components/ui/optimized-image.tsx`)

   - Custom wrapper around Next.js Image
   - Accepts `unoptimized` prop, defaults to false
   - Inherits global config from next.config.ts

2. **PlantCard** (`components/Database/PlantCard.tsx`)

   - Uses `useImageOptimization` hook
   - Sets `unoptimized={!shouldOptimize}`
   - With MAX_OPTIMIZED_IMAGES_PER_PAGE: 0, all images unoptimized

3. **PlantIdentificationResults** (`components/PlantIdentification/PlantIdentificationResults.tsx`)

   - Uses same pattern as PlantCard
   - Respects image-config settings

4. **ImageGallery** (`components/Database/Plant/ImageGallery.tsx`)

   - Uses OptimizedImage component
   - Priority only on first image
   - Inherits global unoptimized setting

5. **Other Components**
   - PlantRecommendationCard, PlantList, Hero Model, etc.
   - All use Next.js Image directly
   - All inherit global `unoptimized: true` from config

## Benefits

- ✅ Zero Vercel image optimization usage
- ✅ Stays within free tier limits
- ✅ No monthly costs
- ✅ Simple to re-enable later (2 config changes)
- ✅ All images still load correctly

## Trade-offs (Acceptable at Current Scale)

- ❌ Larger image file sizes (no format conversion)
- ❌ No automatic AVIF/WebP conversion
- ❌ No automatic responsive sizing
- ❌ Slightly slower page loads (minimal impact at 1.5k visitors/month)

## Re-enabling Optimization (When Revenue Allows)

### Option 1: Re-enable Vercel Optimization

When you want to use Vercel's optimization again:

1. Update `next.config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   unoptimized: false,
   ```

2. Update `lib/image-config.ts`:

   ```typescript
   MAX_OPTIMIZED_IMAGES_PER_PAGE: 4, // Or higher
   ```

3. Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro ($20/month):
   - 10,000 transformations (2x current limit)
   - 1M cache reads, 1M cache writes

### Option 2: External CDN (Recommended Long-term)

For better scalability:

1. **Cloudflare Images** (~$5-10/month)

   - Unlimited optimization
   - $1 per 20k additional images
   - Custom loader implementation needed

2. **Cloudinary** (Free tier available)

   - 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth free
   - $99/month for higher usage

3. **Imgix** ($99/month)
   - Premium image optimization
   - Advanced features

### Option 3: Pre-optimize on Upload

For maximum control (free):

- Pre-process images using Sharp during upload
- Store pre-optimized WebP versions
- Serve directly without Vercel optimization

## Testing Status

✅ Configuration changes verified
✅ No linter errors
✅ Component architecture verified
✅ All image components handle unoptimized correctly

## Deployment Notes

- No build process changes required
- Next.js will skip optimization on next deployment
- Existing cached images unaffected
- New images will serve unoptimized

## Monitoring

After deployment, verify:

1. Images load correctly on all pages
2. Vercel dashboard shows 0 image transformations
3. Page load times remain acceptable
4. No 402 errors in browser console
