- ❌ Monolithic components (176-line GardenCard)
- ❌ Generic corporate dashboard aesthetics
- ❌ Harsh alert colors and rigid layouts

### After

- ✅ 87-line server component (data fetching only)
- ✅ Clean separation: Server (data) → Client (UI + interactions)
- ✅ Composed components (OrganicCard + Content + Actions)
- ✅ Proper client/server boundaries
- ✅ Cozy garden journal aesthetics
- ✅ Soft colors, organic shapes, paper textures
- ✅ Full animation suite with accessibility support
