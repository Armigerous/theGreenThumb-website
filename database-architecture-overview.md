- **GIN Indexes**: Array fields, JSON path queries
- **HNSW Indexes**: Vector similarity search for AI features
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column queries for complex filtering

**Performance Optimizations**:

- **Strategic Denormalization**: Frequently queried data in arrays/JSON
- **Selective Loading**: Modular plant data structure
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequent queries
- **Vector Optimization**: HNSW indexes for real-time AI search

### Composite Index Strategy

**Query Pattern Analysis**:

The composite indexes are designed based on common query patterns identified from UI mockups and user workflows:

**1. Dashboard Queries** - `UserPlant` table:

```sql
-- Query: Fetch user's plants filtered by status, sorted by last health check
WHERE userId = ? AND status = ? ORDER BY lastHealthCheck DESC
-- Index: (userId, status, lastHealthCheck)
```

**Performance Impact**: 5-10x faster dashboard loading, eliminates filesort operations

**2. Task Management** - `UserCareTask` table:

```sql
-- Query: Fetch user's pending tasks sorted by due date
WHERE userId = ? AND isCompleted = false ORDER BY dueDate
-- Index: (userId, isCompleted, dueDate)
```

**Performance Impact**: 3-5x faster task queries, supports efficient pagination

**3. Community Browsing** - `CommunityPost` table:

```sql
-- Query: "Hot" posts sorted by recency and popularity
ORDER BY createdAt DESC, upvotes DESC
-- Index: (createdAt, upvotes)

-- Query: Browse posts by category
WHERE category = ? ORDER BY createdAt DESC
-- Index: (category, createdAt)
```

**Performance Impact**: 2-4x faster community feeds, supports real-time sorting

**4. Garden Health Overview** - `UserPlant` table:

```sql
-- Query: Plants in garden grouped by status
WHERE gardenId = ? GROUP BY status
-- Index: (gardenId, status)
```

**Performance Impact**: Instant garden statistics, no full table scans

**Index Column Ordering Rationale**:

- **Equality Filters First**: userId, gardenId, status (exact matches)
- **Range Filters Last**: dates, scores (ranges and sorting)
- **Most Selective First**: Reduces index scan size
- **Consider Cardinality**: High-cardinality columns benefit most

**Trade-offs**:

- **Write Overhead**: ~15% slower inserts/updates (acceptable for read-heavy app)
- **Storage**: ~10% additional storage for indexes
- **Maintenance**: Indexes updated automatically, minimal overhead

### Expected Performance Improvements

- **60-80% faster queries** through elimination of complex JOINs
- **90% fewer JOINs** required for common operations
- **3x faster plant search** with optimized indexing
- **Real-time AI features** with vector search optimization
- **5-10x faster dashboard queries** with composite indexes
- **No filesort operations** for common sorting patterns

### Audit Logging

**AuditLog Table Structure**:

```prisma
model AuditLog {
  id          String   @id
  userId      String?  // Null for system actions
  action      String   // "create", "update", "delete", "export", "access"
  tableName   String
  recordId    String
  changes     Json?    // Before/after for updates
  ipAddress   String?
  userAgent   String?
  timestamp   DateTime
}
```

## ✅ Data Validation Strategy

### Three-Tier Validation Approach

The database employs a comprehensive three-tier validation strategy to ensure data integrity and quality:

**1. Database Level** (PostgreSQL):

- **Basic Constraints**: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints
- **Foreign Key Integrity**: Cascade rules and referential integrity
- **Data Types**: Strong typing at database level
- **Array Size Limits**: Critical limits enforced via PostgreSQL check constraints
- **Limitations**: Cannot validate complex JSON structures or business logic

**2. Schema Level** (Prisma):

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types generated from Prisma schema
- **Compile-Time Validation**: Catches type errors before runtime
- **Relationship Validation**: Ensures proper foreign key usage
- **Note**: Prisma doesn't support `@default` on JSON fields; empty objects handled in application code
- **Limitations**: Limited runtime validation for dynamic data

**3. Application Level** (Zod Schemas):

- **Runtime Validation**: Validates all API inputs
- **JSON Field Validation**: Validates complex JSON structures and array sizes
- **Business Logic**: Enforces business rules and constraints
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Provides clear error messages for clients
- **Primary Enforcement**: Array size limits (e.g., "Max 10 items") enforced here

### JSON Field Validation

**Validation Location**: `lib/schemas/{domain}.ts`

**Key JSON Fields with Validation**:

1. **User.profile** → `UserProfileSchema`

   - Experience level: enum validation
   - Gardening goals: array max 10 items
   - Available time: enum validation
   - Budget: enum validation

2. **User.preferences** → `UserPreferencesSchema`

   - Notifications: nested object validation
   - Units: enum validation for temperature, measurement
   - Privacy: boolean validation

3. **Garden.location** → `GardenLocationSchema`

   - Coordinates: lat/lng range validation
   - Zone: USDA zone format validation
   - Region: enum validation

4. **Garden.conditions** → `GardenConditionsSchema`

   - Light: array max 5 items
   - Soil: array max 3 items
   - Drainage: enum validation

5. **Garden.preferences** → `GardenPreferencesSchema`
   - Wildlife: array max 10 items
   - Style: array max 5 items
   - Aesthetic theme: array max 3 items

### Array Field Validation

**Maximum Sizes Documented in Schema**:

| Field                                 | Max Items | Rationale                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| User.profile.gardeningGoals           | 10        | Reasonable number of garden goals  |
| Garden.conditions.light               | 5         | Limited light condition types      |
| Garden.conditions.soil                | 3         | Typically 1-2 primary soil types   |
| PlantHealthIssue.symptoms             | 20        | Comprehensive symptom list         |
| PlantHealthIssue.causes               | 15        | Multiple potential causes          |
| PlantHealthIssue.treatment            | 25        | Detailed treatment options         |
| PlantIdentification.images            | 10        | Multiple angles for identification |
| PlantCharacteristics.flowerColor      | 10        | Various color variations           |
| PlantCharacteristics.diseaseResistant | 20        | Multiple disease resistances       |

**Validation Enforcement**:

- API middleware checks array lengths
- Zod schemas enforce maximum sizes
- Clear error messages explain limits
- Frontend enforces limits proactively

### Validation Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[API Route]
    B --> C[Zod Validation]
    C -->|Invalid| D[Return 400 Error with Details]
    C -->|Valid| E[Prisma Client]
    E --> F[Database Constraints]
    F -->|Invalid| G[Return 500 Error]
    F -->|Valid| H[Success Response]

    style C fill:#4ecdc4
    style F fill:#45b7d1
    style D fill:#ff6b6b

- **Plants**: 10K → 100K plant species
- **Data Volume**: 1GB → 100GB+ database
- **AI Features**: Real-time processing for all users

---

## 🎯 User Experience Integration

### User-Centric Data Organization

**Workflow Optimization**:

- **Natural Data Flow**: Database structure matches user mental models
- **Personalized Experience**: User-specific data and recommendations
- **Learning System**: Track user progress and achievements
- **Gamification**: Achievement system and progress tracking

### Feature Integration

**Seamless User Journey**:

1. **Plant Identification**: Upload image → AI analysis → Add to garden
2. **Garden Management**: Create garden → Add plants → Receive recommendations
3. **Care Tracking**: Automated tasks → Log care → Monitor health
4. **Health Monitoring**: Upload health image → Get diagnosis → Apply treatment

---

## 🎯 User Experience Patterns

### How Recommendations Work (On-Demand, Not Push)

**Important Clarification**: Plant recommendations are **NOT** push notifications or aggressive suggestions. They follow an on-demand pattern that gives users full control.

**User-Initiated Flow**:

1. User navigates to "Recommended Plants" page in their garden
2. System queries PlantRecommendation table for garden-specific suggestions
3. Recommendations filtered by:
   - Garden conditions (light, soil, zone)
   - Existing plants in garden
   - User experience level
   - Seasonal appropriateness
4. User browses recommendations at their own pace
5. User can take action: "Add to Garden", "Hide", "Not Interested", "Learn More"

**Refresh Frequency**:

- Recommendations refreshed weekly
- Cached for performance
- Updated when garden conditions change
- User can manually refresh anytime

**User Controls**:

- **"Hide This"**: Remove specific recommendation
- **"Not Interested"**: Hide all recommendations of this type
- **"Already Have"**: Mark as owned (updates future recommendations)
- **"Tell Me More"**: View detailed plant information
- **"Add to Wishlist"**: Save for later consideration

**Data Model Benefits**:

```prisma
model PlantRecommendation {
  gardenId    Int?     // Null for general recommendations
  userId      String?  // Null for general recommendations
  score       Float    // Recommendation strength
  category    RecommendationCategory
  context     Json     // Garden-specific context
  expiresAt   DateTime? // Automatic cleanup of old recommendations
}
```

**Why This Pattern**:

- Respects user attention and autonomy
- No notification fatigue
- User explores when they're ready
- Context-aware without being pushy

### How Care Tasks Work (Suggested, Not Required)

**Important Clarification**: Care tasks are **suggestions**, not mandatory requirements. Users maintain full control over their plant care routine.

**Task Generation Flow**:

1. **Auto-Generated from PlantCareTask** (Base Templates):

   - Plant-specific care tasks (watering, fertilizing, pruning)
   - Seasonal tasks (spring cleanup, winter prep)
   - AI-generated based on plant needs
   - Frequency: daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal

2. **Personalized to UserCareTask**:

   - Adapted to user experience level
   - Adjusted for garden conditions
   - Starts as "Suggested" status
   - User must **activate** to get reminders

3. **Smart Batching**:
   - Group tasks by location (same garden)
   - Group tasks by date (same day/week)
   - "Water all outdoor plants" vs individual tasks
   - Reduces cognitive load and task fragmentation

**User Controls - Maximum Agency**:

- **"Skip This Week"**: Temporarily disable without deleting
- **"Adjust Frequency"**: Change from weekly to bi-weekly, etc.
- **"Disable Task"**: Stop generating this task type
- **"Mark Complete"**: Log completion (feeds into care analytics)
- **"Snooze"**: Postpone by 1 day, 3 days, 1 week
- **"Create Custom"**: User-defined tasks with custom frequency

**Reminder Limits (Anti-Overwhelm)**:

- **Max 5 active reminders per garden**: Prevents notification fatigue
- User chooses which tasks get reminders
- Silent tasks don't send notifications but appear in task list
- Weekly digest option instead of daily reminders

**Task Status Flow**:

```
PlantCareTask (Template)
    ↓
UserCareTask (Suggested)
    ↓
User Activates → Active (with reminders)
    OR
User Ignores → Remains Suggested (no reminders)
    OR
User Disables → Archived (no longer shown)
```

**Data Model Benefits**:

```prisma
model UserCareTask {
  isRecurring       Boolean
  recurringPattern  Json?    // User-customizable
  customInstructions Json?   // User can override defaults
  priority          TaskPriority
  dueDate           DateTime // User can adjust
}
```

**Why This Pattern**:

- Respects different care styles (diligent vs. casual)
- Prevents task burnout and app abandonment
- Adapts to user behavior over time
- Suggestions, not obligations

### Key UX Principles

**1. User Agency First**:

- Users opt-in to features, not opt-out
- Easy to disable or customize any automation
- No dark patterns or forced engagement

**2. Respect User Attention**:

- Recommendations are pull, not push
- Limited notifications prevent fatigue
- Smart batching reduces cognitive load

**3. Progressive Disclosure**:

- Simple defaults for beginners
- Advanced options for experienced users
- Learn and adapt from user behavior

**4. Transparent AI**:

- Show confidence scores for AI recommendations
- Explain why plants are recommended
- Allow users to provide feedback

**5. Graceful Degradation**:

- App works without notifications enabled
- Task system works without reminders
- Recommendations available even if user ignores them
