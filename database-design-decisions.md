    style O fill:#4ecdc4
    style P fill:#4ecdc4
    style Q fill:#4ecdc4
```

**Problems Solved:**

- **Database Locking**: Hard delete on User cascades to hundreds/thousands of related records, locking database during deletion
- **GDPR Right to be Forgotten**: Need 90-day grace period while still appearing "deleted" to users
- **Accidental Deletion**: Users can recover accounts within grace period
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain logs even after user deletion for security/compliance
- **Referential Integrity**: Avoid cascade delete issues with complex foreign key relationships

**Implementation:**

```prisma
model User {
  deletedAt DateTime? @map("deleted_at")

  @@index([deletedAt]) // For filtering active users
}

// All user queries filter:
WHERE deletedAt IS NULL

// Scheduled cleanup job (runs daily):
// 1. Find users where deletedAt < NOW() - 90 days
// 2. Anonymize PII fields
// 3. Keep foreign key references intact for analytics
```

**Trade-offs:**

- **Query Complexity**: Must filter `deletedAt IS NULL` in all user queries (mitigated by Prisma middleware)
- **Storage Overhead**: Deleted user records remain in database (minimal, cleaned after 90 days)
- **Cleanup Job**: Need scheduled job to anonymize old deleted accounts

**Impact:**

- Safer user data management without database locking
- GDPR compliant deletion process with grace period
- Better user experience with account recovery
- Maintains audit trail for security and compliance

### 14. Phased Feature Implementation (V1 Scope Simplification)

**Decision**: Simplify v1 scope by deferring complex features to Phase 2+

**Why This Approach:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[MVP Challenge] --> B[Feature Complexity]
    A --> C[Time to Market]
    A --> D[User Validation]

    B --> E[PlantAestheticPairing<br/>15+ fields]
    B --> F[Expert Monetization<br/>Complex payments]
    B --> G[Advanced Color Theory<br/>Design context]

    E --> H[Defer to Phase 2+]
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Faster Launch]
    H --> J[Prove Core Value]
    H --> K[Learn from Users]

    L[V1 Core Features] --> M[Plant ID & Care]
    L --> N[Garden Management]
    L --> O[Community Q&A]
    L --> P[Basic Recommendations]

    M --> Q[Launch in 3-4 months]
    N --> Q
    O --> Q
    P --> Q

    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style H fill:#4ecdc4
    style Q fill:#4ecdc4
```

**Problems Solved:**

- **Over-Engineering Risk**: Building features users may not need
- **Time to Market**: 3-4 month faster launch without Phase 2+ features
- **User Validation**: Test core assumptions before investing in complexity
- **Development Focus**: Team focuses on core value proposition
- **Technical Debt**: Avoid building complex features that might need redesign

**V1 Scope** (Core - Must Have):

- Plant identification and care information
- Garden management with basic conditions
- Care task suggestions (opt-in)
- Community Q&A without monetization
- Simple plant recommendations
- Basic aesthetic pairings (pairingType, aestheticReason, confidence)

**Phase 2+ Scope** (Advanced - Nice to Have):

- Expert monetization and tipping
- Advanced aesthetic pairings with color theory
- Complex design context (room style, lighting, container types)
- Advanced recommendation algorithms
- Social features (following, achievements, gamification)

**Schema Implementation:**

```prisma
// Phase 2+ fields commented in schema:
model PlantAestheticPairing {
  // V1 ESSENTIALS
  pairingType       String
  aestheticReason   String
  containerSuitable Boolean
  confidence        Float

  // PHASE 2+ FEATURES - Commented for clarity
  // arrangementNotes  String?
  // colorHarmony      String?
  // roomStyle         String[]
  // designSource      String?
}

model CommunityResponse {
  // V1 ESSENTIALS
  content           String
  isExpertResponse  Boolean
  upvotes          Int

  // PHASE 2+ MONETIZATION
  tipAmount        Float?   // Kept for future, not implemented
  platformMatch    Float?   // Kept for future, not implemented
}
```

**Impact:**

- **3-4 month faster launch**: Focus on core features
- **Lower initial development cost**: ~40% less development time
- **User-driven prioritization**: Add features based on real feedback
- **Reduced over-engineering risk**: Build what users actually need
- **Easier maintenance**: Smaller codebase is easier to maintain
- **Faster iteration**: Can pivot based on user behavior

**When to Add Phase 2+ Features:**

- After achieving product-market fit with V1
- When users explicitly request advanced features
- After validating core value proposition
- When revenue justifies development investment

### 15. Composite Index Strategy

**Decision**: Add composite indexes for common multi-column query patterns

**Why This Approach:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Query Patterns Analysis] --> B[Dashboard Queries]
    A --> C[Task Management]
    A --> D[Community Browsing]
    A --> E[Garden Health]

    B --> F[userId + status + date]
    C --> G[userId + isCompleted + dueDate]
    D --> H[category + createdAt]
    D --> I[createdAt + upvotes]
    E --> J[gardenId + status]

    F --> K[Single Composite Index]
    G --> K
    H --> K
    I --> K
    J --> K

    K --> L[5-10x Faster Queries]
    K --> M[No Filesort Operations]
    K --> N[Efficient Pagination]

    O[Single-Column Indexes] --> P[Multiple Index Scans]
    P --> Q[Slower Performance]
    P --> R[Filesort Operations]

    style K fill:#4ecdc4
    style L fill:#4ecdc4
    style M fill:#4ecdc4
    style N fill:#4ecdc4
    style Q fill:#ff6b6b
    style R fill:#ff6b6b
```

**Problems Solved:**

- **Slow Dashboard Queries**: Multi-column WHERE + ORDER BY requires filesort
- **Poor Pagination**: Offset-based pagination slow without composite indexes
- **Inefficient Filtering**: Multiple single indexes less efficient than one composite
- **Query Planner Confusion**: Database might choose wrong index without composite

**Key Query Patterns & Solutions:**

**1. Dashboard - User's Plants by Status**

```sql
-- Query
SELECT * FROM UserPlant
WHERE userId = ? AND status = 'HEALTHY'
ORDER BY lastHealthCheck DESC

-- Without composite:
-- 1. Scan userId index
-- 2. Filter by status in memory
-- 3. Filesort by lastHealthCheck
-- Time: ~200ms for 1000 plants

-- With composite (userId, status, lastHealthCheck):
-- 1. Single index scan covers everything
-- Time: ~20ms for 1000 plants (10x faster)
```

**2. Task Management - Pending Tasks**

```sql
-- Query
SELECT * FROM UserCareTask
WHERE userId = ? AND isCompleted = false
ORDER BY dueDate

-- Composite index: (userId, isCompleted, dueDate)
-- Performance: 5x faster, supports efficient pagination
```

**3. Community Hot Feed**

```sql
-- Query
SELECT * FROM CommunityPost
ORDER BY createdAt DESC, upvotes DESC
LIMIT 20

-- Composite index: (createdAt, upvotes)
-- Performance: 3x faster for "hot" sorting algorithm
```

**Index Column Ordering Rules:**

1. **Equality Filters First**: `userId = ?`, `status = ?`
2. **Range Filters Last**: `lastHealthCheck >`, `ORDER BY date`
3. **Most Selective First**: High-cardinality columns benefit most
4. **Left-to-Right Usage**: Index used left-to-right until range operation

**Trade-offs:**

- **Write Overhead**: ~15% slower inserts/updates (3 indexes updated per row)
- **Storage Overhead**: ~10% additional storage for indexes
- **Index Maintenance**: Automatic, minimal developer overhead
- **Index Selection**: PostgreSQL query planner handles selection

**Verification Query:**

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM UserPlant
WHERE userId = 'user123' AND status = 'HEALTHY'
ORDER BY lastHealthCheck DESC;

-- Expected output:
-- Index Scan using UserPlant_userId_status_lastHealthCheck_idx
-- No "Sort" operation (filesort eliminated)
```

**Impact:**

- **5-10x faster dashboard queries**: Most common user operation
- **Eliminates filesort operations**: No in-memory sorting needed
- **Efficient pagination**: Offset-based and cursor-based both fast
- **Better user experience**: Sub-second response times
- **Acceptable write cost**: Read-heavy app benefits from read optimization

### 16. JSON Field Defaults & Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Remove Prisma `@default` on JSON fields; handle defaults in application code

**Why This Approach:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Prisma Limitation] --> B[No JSON Default Support]
    B --> C[Migration/Generate Fails]

    D[Solution Strategy] --> E[Application-Level Defaults]
    D --> F[Zod Schema Validation]
    D --> G[Database Check Constraints]

    E --> H[Initialize on Create]
    E --> I[Seed Empty Objects]

    F --> J[Array Size Limits]
    F --> K[JSON Structure Validation]
    F --> L[Business Logic Rules]

    G --> M[Critical Limits Only]
    G --> N[PostgreSQL Constraints]

    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style B fill:#ff6b6b
    style D fill:#4ecdc4
    style H fill:#4ecdc4
    style J fill:#4ecdc4
    style M fill:#4ecdc4
```

**Problems Solved:**

- **Prisma Limitation**: Cannot use `@default("{}")` on JSON fields without migration errors
- **Validation Gap**: Array size limits (e.g., "Max 10 items") noted in comments but not enforced
- **Data Quality**: Need comprehensive validation for complex JSON structures

**Implementation Strategy:**

**1. JSON Field Defaults (Application Layer):**

```typescript
// In service layer or repository
async createUser(data: CreateUserInput) {
  return prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      ...data,
      profile: data.profile || {},
      preferences: data.preferences || {},
      stats: data.stats || {},
    }
  });
}
```

**2. Array Size Validation (Zod Schemas):**

```typescript
// lib/schemas/user.ts
export const UserProfileSchema = z.object({
	experience: z.enum(["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced", "expert"]),
	gardeningGoals: z
		.array(z.string())
		.max(10, "Maximum 10 gardening goals allowed"),
	availableTime: z.enum(["daily", "weekends", "seasonal"]),
	budget: z.enum(["low", "moderate", "high"]),
});
```

**3. Critical Database Constraints (PostgreSQL):**

```sql
-- For high-risk fields that must never exceed limits
ALTER TABLE "PlantHealthIssue"
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_symptoms_length
  CHECK (array_length(symptoms, 1) <= 20);

ALTER TABLE "PlantCharacteristics"
  ADD CONSTRAINT check_flower_color_length
  CHECK (array_length("flower_color", 1) <= 10);
```

**Validation Flow:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Request] --> B[Zod Schema Validation]
    B -->|Invalid| C[400 Error: Clear Message]
    B -->|Valid| D[Application Logic]
    D --> E[Set JSON Defaults if Null]
    E --> F[Prisma Client]
    F --> G[Database Constraints]
    G -->|Violation| H[500 Error: Log & Alert]
    G -->|Pass| I[Success]

    style B fill:#4ecdc4
    style E fill:#4ecdc4
    style G fill:#feca57
    style C fill:#ff6b6b
    style H fill:#ff6b6b
```

**Trade-offs:**

- **Application Complexity**: More validation logic in application layer
- **Consistency Risk**: Must ensure all create/update operations set defaults
- **Performance**: Minimal impact; validation happens once per request
- **Safety**: Three-tier validation provides comprehensive protection

**Best Practices:**

- **Primary Validation**: Zod schemas for all array sizes and JSON structures
- **Secondary Validation**: Database constraints for critical limits (e.g., symptoms, treatments)
- **Tertiary Validation**: Prisma type safety for compile-time checks
- **Middleware Option**: Consider global API middleware for common validations

**Impact:**

- Prisma migrations work without JSON default errors
- Comprehensive validation at appropriate layers
- Clear error messages for developers and users
- Critical data protected by database constraints
- Flexibility to adjust validation rules without migrations
